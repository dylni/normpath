# NormPath

This crate provides methods to normalize paths in the recommended way for the
operating system.

It was made to fix a recurring bug caused by using [`fs::canonicalize`] on
Windows: [#45067], [#48249], [#52440], [#55812], [#58613], [#59107], [#74327].
Normalization is usually a better choice unless you specifically need a
canonical path.

[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/dylni/normpath/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/dylni/normpath/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

## Usage

Add the following lines to your "Cargo.toml" file:

```toml
[dependencies]
normpath = "1.1"
```

See the [documentation] for available functionality and examples.

## Rust version support

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust 1.57.0.

Minor version updates may increase this version requirement. However, the
previous two Rust releases will always be supported. If the minimum Rust
version must not be increased, use a tilde requirement to prevent updating this
crate's minor version:

```toml
[dependencies]
normpath = "~1.1"
```
