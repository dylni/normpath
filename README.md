# NormPath

This crate provides methods to normalize paths in the recommended way for the
operating system.

It was made to fix a recurring bug caused by using [`fs::canonicalize`] on
Windows: [#45067], [#48249], [#52440], [#55812], [#58613], [#59107], [#74327].
Normalization is usually a better choice unless you specifically need a
canonical path.
